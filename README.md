## Overview
The aim of the project is to uncover correlations within commercial movie data. We’ll look at movie genres and ratings from the year 2000 forward and determine relationships between variables to provide recommendations.

## Features
Item-based Recommendation: Utilizes item characteristics and user ratings to generate recommendations.

## Installation
Dependencies needed:
- import pandas as pd
- from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
- import numpy as np
- 

## Steps

1. Data Preparation
Files are easy to read CSVs.
File size has been reduced to a manageable size (from 335MB to 1.2MB )

3. Training the model
Adjusting hyperparameters and configurations for optimal performance.

4. Generating recommendations
Utilize the trained model to generate recommendations for movies.

## Example




## Evaluation
Precision: Measure of the accuracy of the recommended items
